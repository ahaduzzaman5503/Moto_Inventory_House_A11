### What are the differences between Node.JS and Javascript?
 
### The main difference between Node.JS and Javascript is Javascript can run in the browsers and be used on the client-side. On the other hand, NodeJS can run outside of the browser and be used on the server-side. Javascript is a high-level programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript that runs on the Javascript V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
